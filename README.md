# AdventOfCode2020
My solutions for this year's advent of code. I'm just doing it to learn python.

If you are unfamiliar with advent of code, it is a December / advent calendar challenge each year with daily exercises in coding. Exercises involve most basic CS concepts, including recursion, reading a file, linked lists, and basic data structures.
